When the Epomaker P75 launched last year, it impressed us with its build quality and laundry list of features, especially for a board that retails for less than $100. And while the mechanical keyboard has since been discontinued, it remains an excellent choice you can still pick up with either the linear or tactile switches [&#8230;]
