Snacking giant Mondelez is using generative AI to slash marketing costs and is preparing to release AI-generated TV ads next year, a senior executive told Reuters. Jon Halvorson, Mondelezâ€™s global senior vice president of consumer experience, said the company has spent more than $40 million on an AI video tool that can halve production costs.
